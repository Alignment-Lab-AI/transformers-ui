# Transformers UI

## Overview

Transformers UI is an accessible graphical user interface (GUI) project that aims to unlock and streamline the complete capabilities of the Hugging Face's Transformers library. This interface is currently in its early stages of development.

Despite the versatility and powerful functionality offered by the Transformers library, many users only know about and use a fraction of its capabilities. This is largely because the library comprises numerous moving parts and intricate interrelationships, which can make it daunting and difficult to navigate.

Transformers UI is designed to address this issue. It provides an intelligent UI to handle pipelines and functions from the Transformers library. This lightweight, easy-to-run, no-code platform allows users to train, edit, deploy, and run inference with every model in the Transformers library. It also lets users manipulate data in all ways designed by the `datasets` library.

## Features

Each interface within Transformers UI has a clean, simple structure and provides visual indicators like graphs, charts, and more. These visual tools aid users in understanding aspects such as the density of training data, evaluations during training, and comparing inferences.

Transformers UI also caters to more advanced users by offering a 'Pro Mode'. This mode enables automation and intelligent management of the more intricate tasks involved in using the library at a high level.

There's a thought to possibly integrating an AI to assist in managing these complex tasks. However, this is still under consideration and planning.

## Contributions

Transformers UI is a community project and we welcome contributions. If you'd like to improve the UI, add new features, or fix bugs, please feel free to submit a pull request.
